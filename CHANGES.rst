1.0a1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Prefill and lock the "My user name is" field on the password-reset /
  "set your password" form when the invite link carries a ``?userid=``
  query parameter, so a newly-added member does not have to know or retype
  their own username. Self-service "forgot password" links (which carry no
  ``userid``) keep an empty, editable field. Implemented as a z3c.jbot
  override of ``Products.CMFPlone``'s ``pwreset_form`` template.
